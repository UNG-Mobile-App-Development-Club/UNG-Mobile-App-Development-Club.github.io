## 🚀 Deployment with GitHub Pages  
This repository is set up to **automatically deploy** to **GitHub Pages**. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will be reflected live on the website after a short delay.  

### **How to Update the Website**  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UNG-App-Development-Club/ung-app-dev-club.github.io.git
   cd ung-app-dev-club.github.io
   ```

2. **Make changes to `index.html`, `styles.css`, or other files.**  

3. **Commit and push your changes:**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated website content"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update.** Your changes will be live at:  
   🔗 [https://ung-app-dev-club.github.io/](https://ung-app-dev-club.github.io/)

## 🛠 Recommended Workflow  
To avoid directly pushing to `main`, follow this Git workflow:  
1. **Create a new branch for changes:**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b yourName/update-homepage
   ```
2. **Make your edits and commit changes.**  
3. **Push your branch and create a pull request (PR) to `main`.**  
4. **After approval, merge the PR and the website will update automatically.**

## 🖥️ Local Development  
If you want to preview your changes before pushing:  
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Use **Live Server** in VS Code or run a simple local server:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
